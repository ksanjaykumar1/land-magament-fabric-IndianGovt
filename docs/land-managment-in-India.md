## Land Ownership 

## Current System 

India currently follows a system of presumptive land titling. This means a person is presumed to be the owner of land unless someone proves otherwise. 

The government maintains multiple types of land records at different Department: 

1. **Department of Stamps and Registration** : Responsible for registering and keeping record of sale deed and collecting the stamp duty and registration fees. 
2. **Department of Revenue** : Responsible for keeping revenue record to be collected tax for each piece of land and from whom the tax must be collected. 
3. **Department of Survey and Land Records**: To survey each piece of land and record its geographic location, sand type etc.

Steps taken to transfer property.
1. Transfer of property through sale 
    
 Part I at Department of Stamps and Registration (Registration)

    1. Buyer verifies who owns property
    2. Buyer requests for Encumbrance Certificate (EC) from Seller. Seller gets this certificate from Department of Stamps and Registration. This certificate proves the land is not under any legal dispute.
    3. Finds the market Value of Land and buys the stamp paper.
    4. Creates the Sale deed on stamp paper and is signed by the buyer and seller.
    5. Property is registered by sub-registrar, to whom seller and buyer submit the: 
        1. sale deed
        2. Documents to prove the ownership of previous owner.
        3. Pays the registration fees. 
    6. Sub-registrar verifies all the documents and checks whether proper stamp duty and registration fee is paid. 
    7. Sub-registrar authenticates Seller, Buyer and 2 witness.
    8. Sub-registrar records the sale deed. 
    9. Sub-registrar issues Encumbrance Certificate.
    
Part II at Department of Revenue (Mutation)
    
    " Mutation is that act which results in the transfer or change of property title entry in revenue records of the local authority. "

    1. Following documents are submitted to sub-divisional office.
        1. Copy of sale of deed
        2. Encumbrance Certificate 
    2. Documents are verified. 
    3. Their local documents are checked 
    4. The person submitting the documents is authenticated.
    5. If everything is proper then the owner of land is changed in the revenue records also called as "Jamabandi register". 
    6. Record or rights document is issued to the document presenter. 


Problem with the current system 
1. “Right now, because land titles are based on transactions, people have to keep the entire chain of transaction records, and a dispute on any link in that chain causes ambiguity in ownership,” says Dr. Haque.



## Proposed New System by Govt.

 NITI Aayog, a government agency which provides policy inputs, drafted a Bill called "Model Bill" in 2020 which proposes to move to conclusive land titling system.

 In this new system, Each state government will grant land title to citizens under its jurisdiction. Government will be responsible for maintaining the ownership of each piece of land. Any dispute in the ownership would be between Government and the Citizen, earlier it was between the citizen who claim the ownership. 

## Need For Blockchain 

1. Help in **cross department operation**.
2. **Access management** of multiple ledgers which are maintained by different departments. 
3. **Digitally executable legally binding transactions**. 
4. **On-chain Verifiable Cryptographic audit log**, Maintain log of all transaction with accurate digital signature of the different parties involved i.e. helps in non-repudiation, a entity cannot deny that they are not responsible. Will be easy to track the officer or party responsible for particular transaction.
5. **Single source of truth**, In centralized systems, it is hard to synchronize the data from various subdivisions. Using Blockchain, various subdivisions can operate on a single ledger and can maintain consistency and integrity.
